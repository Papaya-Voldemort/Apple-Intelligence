## Enhancement Ideas

Here are three improvement ideas for Apple Chat Pro:

1. **Limited Offline Support**
   - Allow users to access recent conversations and basic features even when offline. Cache essential data locally and provide a clear offline mode experience.

2. **Profile Experience**
   - Enable users to set a display name and avatar. Personalize the chat experience by showing user profiles in conversations and settings.

3. **Notification Support**
   - Add support for desktop and mobile notifications. Notify users of new messages, important updates, or reminders, even when the app is running in the background.
